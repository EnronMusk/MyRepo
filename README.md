This is my repo just for fun projects outside of school. I currently am working on the ReviewGPT project.

## Review GPT
This project compares ChatGPT review rating prediction performance to GBM and neural network models used for rating predictions using keywords. Found ChatGPT 3.5 to excel at predicting binary i.e positive or negative reviews but poor at predicting
the actual rating number. However, in both cases it has an edge over the GBM and neural network in accuracy. ChatGPT 4.0 might have better results in rating prediction.

## Kaggle
Holds models used in Kaggle competitions. Not competitve, just trying to learn new techniques/strategies.

## Miss Pricing
Investigated if there was a statistical argument to vary profit margins by risk class in P&C insurance. Found no evidence as long as the risk classes follow the same distribution. If high risk insureds
follow distributions that vary from the assumed Gamma, they will significantly damage the profitability of the insurers portfolio and should have an increased profit margin to compensate.
