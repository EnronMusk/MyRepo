This is my repo just for fun projects outside of school. I currently am working on the ReviewGPT project.

## Review GPT
Currently trying to compare ChatGPT review rating prediction performance to traditional GBM models used for rating predictions using keywords. Found Chat GPT to excel at predicting binary i.e positive or negative reviews but very poor at predicting
the actual rating number.
